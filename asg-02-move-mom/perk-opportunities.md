# Asg 02 Perk Opportunities

To qualify for the following Perks, you need to submit your current assignment (just like you would a drill) and run the submit Action as always. From the resulting report, I'll be able to see which level of tests (F+ or D+ or C+) you've reached.

Deadlines are by end of day (11:59 PM) on the given days.

If you:

- complete the F+ level on or before Mar 12: **1 Perk**
- complete the D+ level on or before Mar 15: **+2 Perks**
- complete the C+ level on or before Mar 19: **+2 Perks**
