# C Level Overview

For this level, you'll be showing you can create a simple Map data structure.

- you must use the `MySimpleBst` class to create a class called `MySimpleTreeMap` that implements the `SimpleMap` interface provided in `main.interfaces`. (That is, you'll use your working `MySimpleBst` class as the backing data structure for your `MySimpleTreeMap`.)

    > _If you look through the SimpleMap interface and some of the C level tests, you'll see that there is mention of `MyMapEntry` - that class has been provided for you in `main.datastructs`._
    
- your `MySimpleTreeMap` class must pass all of the tests in the `test.c.level` package classes
