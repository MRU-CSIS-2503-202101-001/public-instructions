## Assignment One - Exploding Lists

### Grade: F

- no attempt, or even 1 compilation error is present in the project

### Grade: D

- everything from level F+ is true, and
- all tests in 6 or 7 of the `test.d.level` package classes pass

### Grade: D+

- everything from level D is true, and
- all tests in the `test.d.plus.level` package pass

### Grade: C- range

- everything from the D+ level is true, and
- all tests in the `test.c.minus.level` package pass

### Grade: C range

- everything from the C- level is true, and
- all tests in the `test.c.level` package pass

## DESIGN GUIDELINES from B onward

- From B onward, I start to pay attention to your coding style; if I like what you see, you'll trend toward the + level.

> If you want to know what I'm looking for, see my [design guidelines](design-guidelines.md).

- For the B and A levels, I'm also looking for applications that are reasonably stable - they should handle user input errors in a non-annoying fashion and shouldn't crash unexpectedly.

- I also expect no Checkstyle and no PMD warnings; if there are warnings present, that'll trend you downward to the minus level.

### Grade: B range

- everything from the C+ level is true, and
- all necessary features have been implemented, and
- the program *must* use your Map,and
- you and JP get together in a Meet and we do a demo of your program. 

### Grade: A

**this is a challenging level, as befits an A. Even if you just have a *partially working* A-level solution, please still demo to JP, as there is a reasonable chance of getting an A- if you have progressed far enough.**

- everything from the C+ level is true, and
- a Map must be used to determine pull outcomes, as is done in the B level, and
- most or all necessary features have been implemented, and
- you and JP get together in a Meet and we do a demo of your program
