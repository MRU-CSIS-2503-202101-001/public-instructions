# C+ Level Overview

This level is about balancing - you must get `isBalanced` and `balance` working properly in the `MySimpleBst` class.

If you pass all of the tests in the `test.c.plus.level` package classes, you're done this level.

If you've finished this level, you should now have a BST class that you can balance if needed and since that BST is used behind-the-scenes in your MySimpleTreeMap class, your Map can be balanced as well.
