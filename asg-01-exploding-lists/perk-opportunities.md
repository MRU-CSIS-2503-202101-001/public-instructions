# Asg 01 Perk Opportunities

To qualify for the following Perks, you need to submit your current assignment (just like you would a drill) and run the submit Action as always. From the resulting report, I'll be able to see which level of tests (F+, D, D+, C) you've reached.

Deadlines are by end of day (11:59 PM) on the given days.

If you:

- complete the F+ level on or before Feb 06: **+1 Perk**
- complete the D level on or before Feb 06: **+2 Perks**
- complete the D+ level on or before Feb 13: **+1 Perk**
- complete the C level on or before Feb 13: **+2 Perks**

> Some examples:  
> - you complete the F+ level on Feb 05, miss the D level deadline, but manage to get the D+ level done under the wire on Feb 13: you'd get 2 Perks
> - you complete the F+, D, and D+ levels by Feb 04...but then miss the C level by a day: you'd get 4 Perks
> - you get the F+ and D levels in by Feb 06, get the D+ level done on Feb 10, and then get the C level done on Feb 12: you'd get 6 Perks
