# A- Level Overview

This level? 

It might hurt a bit.

Again, you've got a single custom class to complete here - `ExplodingIndexablePluckableQueue` (whew - mouthful) which implements not one, not two, but **three** interfaces:  `PluckableQueue<T>`, `ExplosivelyPluckable<T>`, and IndexableCursor.

This is the class that is meant to capture the "explosive" pluck idea - that when you pluck something from this PluckableQueue, if the two adjoining items are identical, an "explosion" occurs...and this might set up a chain reaction.
