# D+ Level Overview

OK. That wasn't so bad, right?

_(You're supposed to either say, "right" or "&*#!@ you, Pratt" here.)_

This level focuses on your completion of one custom class:

1. `MyGrabBag`, which should implement the `GrabBag` interface. You can use any collection under the hood to implement this class.

In this level - and all levels - tests in the package corresponding to the level must pass!
