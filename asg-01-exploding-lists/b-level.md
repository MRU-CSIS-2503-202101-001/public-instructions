# B Level Overview

This level is about completing a single class, `ListBackedPluckableQueue<T>` which implements the `PluckableQueue<T>` interface.

This is a bit easier said than done, as you can surmise by looking at the interface - this is not a traditional queue. Also, since you're coding with your own linked lists, there's ***that*** complexity involved as well. And I've tossed `Optional` in here as well.

> _Feel free to use code from the online textbook (you remember that from the course outline) here to make this easier for you. If you **do** use code from there - or anywhere else online - please just reference it in your class documentation. Failure to do so means you're being naughty, which will have repercussions._
