## Assignment One - Exploding Lists

### Grade: F

- no attempt, or even 1 compilation error is present in the project

### Grade: F+

_Although MRU doesn't have an F+, JP does! To convert an F+ to the 4.0 scale, I just call it a 0.5. It's not much - but it's a helluva lot better than 0!_

- no compilation errors are present in your project

### Grade: D

- everything from level F+ is true, and
- all tests in the `test.d.level` package pass, and
- the first `// TODO` in `Main.java` is answered

### Grade: D+

- everything from level D is true, and
- all tests in the `test.d.plus.level` package pass

#### DESIGN GUIDELINES

From C onward, I start to pay attention to your coding style; if I like what you see, you hit the + level. 

If you want to know what I'm looking for, see my [design guidelines](design-guidelines.md).

### Grade: C range

- everything from the D+ level is true, and
- all tests in the `test.c.level` package pass, and
- all public methods in `ListBackedPluckableQueue` are documented in Javadoc style. Here's what I'm looking for with your Javadoc: https://blog.joda.org/2012/11/javadoc-coding-standards.html

**The difference between a C-, C, and C+:**

  - if the stated tests are passing and you have **no** Checkstyle and PMD warnings, you get a C
  - if you have **even one** Checkstyle or PMD warning, you will get a C-
  - if you're at a C and I like the code I see, you get a C+

### Grade: B range

- everything from the C level is true, and
- all tests in the `test.b.level` package pass, and
- all public methods in `ExplodingIndexablePluckableQueue` are documented in Javadoc style

The difference between a B-, B, and B+:
  - if the stated tests are passing and you have **no** Checkstyle and PMD warnings, you get a B
  - if you have **even one** Checkstyle or PMD warning, you will get a B-
  - if you're at a B and I like the code I see, you get a B+

### Grade: A-

- everything from the B level is true, and
- all tests in the `test.aminus.level` package pass, and
- all public methods in `MarbleColumn` are documented in Javadoc style, and
- you have no Checkstyle/PMD warnings

### Grade: A

- everything from the A- level is true, and
- all tests in the `test.a.level` package pass, and
- you've done the sole `// TODO` in the `Main.java`, and
- you have no Checkstyle/PMD warnings, and
- you have a fully functioning App (which I will test by using some custom `startup.ini` files and seeing if things "work as expected")

### Grade: A+

- everything from the A level is true, and
- you implement the Undo feature, and
- your code impresses me
