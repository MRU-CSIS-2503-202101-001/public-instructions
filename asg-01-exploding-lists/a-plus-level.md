# A+ Level Overview

If you've gotten this far, I'm impressed - as befits A-level work.

The A+ level is more of a test of character than anything - you see, if you've looked at the marking scheme for this course, you'll see that **both an A and an A+ are worth a 4.0.**

Let that sink in a bit.

Said another way, _getting an A+ means the same thing, mark-wise, as an A._

What **does** an A+ get you then?

Bragging rights. And a sense of accomplishment. (Yes - I'm serious.)

It's up to you.

Still interested? If so, then your final task is to implement the Undo feature of the app. This will require you to work with the `undoStack` field in `App.java` and to use it in the methods where the state of the game changes. (What are they?) Obviously, you'll also need to code up the `handleUndo` helper method in `App.java` as well!
