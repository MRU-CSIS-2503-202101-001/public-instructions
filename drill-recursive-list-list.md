# Drill - Recursive List List

_(aka Yes Yes List List)_

**Accept this project by going here:** https://classroom.github.com/a/XuzRor9U

## Preamble

Another venture into Recursive Land. It's just a small incursion.

We'll use a slightly modded version of the SimpleLinkedList from the Recursive hasAny drill, so it might be a *bit* better if you did that one first - but you don't have to.


## Skills Covered

Show you can...

- [ ] implement recursive methods.
- [ ] design and code recursive algorithms over lists.


## Instructions

1. Complete the `SimpleLinkedList` class methods marked with a `// TODO`. There are just two of them.   
   1. if all the tests in the `test` package pass, yadayadayada! Yada!
  

## Example Run

No example run for this one - all testing is done through unit tests.

## Hints

- Use the "public recursive wrapper + private recursive method" style of recursive coding here. I've gotten you started with the outline of the public wrappers....
