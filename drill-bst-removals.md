# Drill - BST Removals

_(aka You **really** thought you'd be in that tree forever?)_

**Accept this project by going here:** https://classroom.github.com/a/K9T49GwC

## Preamble

Just a short hop on this one: putting stuff into a BST is obviously an important thing...but sometimes, you just wanna nuke an entry.

To indulge these destructive inclinations, you'll take your `MySimpleBst` class from assignment two and add a single function to it: `remove`. You'll likely want to implement this method recursively, though you're not forced to do so.



## Skills Covered

Show you can...

- [ ] make a binary search tree.


## Instructions

1. Add your `MySimpleBst` from assignment 2 to the `main` package and them make sure it implements the `SimpleBst` interface. (This should just mean implementing `remove`!)
   1. Yep. Pass the tests and you're done. Le whee!
  

## Example Run

No example run for this one - all testing is done through unit tests.
