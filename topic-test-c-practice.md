# Topic Test C - Practice

**Accept this project by going here:** https://classroom.github.com/a/VWT2alV7

## WARNING!

Don't use any loops, 'kay? This practice - and the coding test C - are all about using recursion!

There's an annoying unit test that'll look for any use of the word "for" or "while" to enforce this....even in comments!

## Preamble

This is a **practice** test, meant to see how well you've mastered material learned in drills and in lecture.

This practice test is a _little_ harder (IMO) than the real deal, so will likely take you a little longer. This is on purpose.

Try not to look at the [solution video](xx) before giving this practice test your best effort. *Trying and stumbling is infinitely more effective than passively watching someone else do something **you** should be doing.*

If you get stuck on something, make note of it and get better at it before the real test!


## Skills Assessed

You will show that you can, under time-pressure:

- [ ] implement recursive methods.

## Hints & Suggestions Before You Begin

- log into GitHub
- open up the folder where you keep your Eclipse projects in Windows Explorer / Mac Finder
- have a Git Bash (Windows) / Terminal (Mac) open in the location where you keep your Eclipse projects
- have Eclipse open and ready to roll
- close any other open projects in Eclipse
- stay focused on one task at a time; it is really easy to get intimidated and/or lost in code if you stop focusing!
- get things compiling, even if you have to stub things out; it'll both increase your mark and also get your tests running...which is also important to your mark


## Instructions

> _**Important Note**  
>  Because of how the submission system works, if you have any classes that DON'T compile, the results of your submission won't show your tests behaving the same way as they do in Eclipse. So try really hard to get your classes to compile, even if you have to stub out some things!_

1. Complete the 2 methods in the `ArrayPrintUtil` class, following the instructions in their `// TODOs`. 
    1. If you have completed the 2 methods correctly, all the associated tests should pass.
1. Complete the method in the `StringUtil` class, following the instructions in its `// TODO`. 
    1. If you have completed the method correctly, all the associated tests should pass.
1. Add the 2 methods in the `SuperSimpleLinkedList` class mentioned in the `// TODO` in that class. 
    1. If you have completed the methods correctly, all the associated tests should pass.


## Where are the Main Tests?

There are none! All the tests in this Practice Test - and the Real Test -  are unit tests.

## Marks

The following is the marking rubric for the Real Test.

> **Note**  
> Checkstyle and PMD warnings only have a bearing on your mark if your work is the A range, so don't worry about them unless everything is compiling and all your tests are running green! 

### Grade: F

- no attempt, or the code present is wildly incorrect

### Grade: D

- few, if any, files compile - but there is enough code present that the instructor can see that the student was at least on the right track 

### Grade: C range

- no compilation problems
- neither method has ***all*** its associated tests passing, but at least **_some_** tests are passing
- where you fall in this range will be a judgement call

### Grade: B range

- no compilation problems
- one of the two methods is passing all its related tests; the other method is passing at least _some_ of its related tests; where you fall in B range depends on how many "some" is!

### Grade: A range

- no compilation problems
- no tests with errors or failures
- the number of checkstyle and pmd warnings present determines where in this range you are:
  - no warnings: A+
  - 1 or 2 warnings: A
  - 3 or more warnings: A-
